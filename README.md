Vopros
======

A simple Drupal distribution for question and answer sites in a library
context.

To build an install profile without Drupal core, run:

    drush make --no-core --contrib-destination=. vopros.make

If you want a developer version with Git working copies, run this
command instead:

    drush make --no-core --contrib-destination=. --working-copy vopros.make
